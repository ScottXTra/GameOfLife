# Game Of Life
(Wikipedia)
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 

I recently took and intrist in cellular automaton and the ways it relates to how so many fundamental processes it takes hold in.

I took the afternoon to implement the legendary Game Of Life by John Conway to dip my toes in.
